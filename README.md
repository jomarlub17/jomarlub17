##  About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for **backend systems** and **AI/ML**. I love that moment when a random idea pops into my head and I get to bring it to life through code. Whether it's building robust APIs, training models, or crafting seamless user experiences, I'm all about creating things that actually work (and hopefully impress).

-  Currently exploring the intersection of AI and practical applications
-  Always working on that next idea that won't let me sleep
-  Building scalable backends and intelligent systems
-  Learning something new every day (it's a requirement in this field)
